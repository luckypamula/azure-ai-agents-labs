    "# Lab 5: Develop a Multi-Agent System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we build a modern, production-ready multi-agent system using the latest Azure AI Python SDKs and best practices (as of mid-2025).\n",
    "- Each agent is created as a connected agent using Azure AI Agent Service.\n",
    "- Orchestration is performed using direct agent-to-agent calls, not just a group chat or plugin pattern.\n",
    "- Uses official Microsoft documentation patterns for agent creation, tool/resource registration, and message passing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-agent system we create will consist of 3 agents that work together to generate detailed reports about health insurance policy documents, brought together using orchestration logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search Agent - This agent will search our Azure AI Search index for information about specific health plan policies.\n",
    "2. Report Agent - This agent will generate a detailed report about the health plan policy based on the information returned from the Search Agent.\n",
    "3. Validation Agent - This agent will validate that the generated report meets specified requirements. In our case, making sure that the report contains information about coverage exclusions.\n",
    "4. Orchestrator logic - we use direct orchestration logic written in Python to coordinate the three agents (Search, Report, Validation) using the Azure AI Agent Service SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "Orchestration is a key part of multi-agentic systems since the agents that we create need to be able to communicate with each other in order to accomplish the objective. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the Azure AI Agent Service not only to create the Search, Report, and Validation agents, but also to build our orchestration logic! At Microsoft Build 2025, Microsoft announced that the Azure AI Agent Service SDK now supports multi-agent capabilities natively. This means you can create, connect, and orchestrate multiple agents directly using the SDK, without needing Semantic Kernel or a dedicated Orchestrator Agent. The SDK provides official patterns for agent creation, tool/resource registration, and agent-to-agent communication, enabling more flexible and production-ready multi-agent systems.\n",

The plan is designed to cater to a broad spectrum of healthcare needs, emphasizing preventive care and efficient management of prescription drugs. Subscribers of this plan have access to a wide array of in-network healthcare providers, ensuring choices among primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies.\\n\\n#### Coverage Components\\n\\n1. **Medical Services**: \\n   - **Preventive Care**: The plan covers a full range of preventive services, ensuring access to routine check-ups, vaccinations, screenings, and other preventive measures without additional costs.\\n   - **In-Network Providers**: Choosing in-network services facilitates lower out-of-pocket expenses and streamlined approvals for covered treatments.\\n\\n2. **Vision Services**: \\n   - Coverage includes regular eye exams and possibly discounts or allowances towards eyewear, enhancing eye health maintenance.\\n\\n3. **Dental Services**: \\n   - Basic dental care is included, covering routine check-ups, cleanings, and possibly more extensive dental work, depending on the specifics outlined by the plan.\\n\\n4. **Prescription Drug Coverage**: \\n   - Comprehensive drug coverage is part of the plan, making medications more affordable when purchased through in-network pharmacies.\\n\\n#### Coverage Exclusions\\nDespite its comprehensive nature, the Northwind Standard plan does have notable exclusions:\\n\\n1. **Emergency Services**: \\n   - Urgent or emergency care services, typically vital services in unforeseen circumstances, are not covered. Enrollees will need to bear full costs for any emergency care sought.\\n\\n2. **Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services**: \\n   - This exclusion poses a significant limitation as it omits coverage for psychiatric services, counseling, and treatments related to substance abuse.\\n\\n3. **Out-of-Network Services**: \\n   - Services obtained from providers who are not part of the plan\\u2019s network are not covered. This necessitates careful selection of in-network providers to take full advantage of the plan.\\n\\n4. **Cosmetic Services**: \\n   - Any surgeries or treatments strictly for cosmetic purposes are not included in the coverage, reinforcing the plan\\u2019s focus on medically necessary interventions.\\n\\n5. **Non-Medically Necessary Services**: \\n   - Procedures or treatments not classified as medically essential are excluded from coverage under this plan.\\n\\n#### Utilization Recommendations\\nTo maximize the benefits and manage costs effectively under the Northwind Standard plan, it is advisable to:\\n\\n- **Utilize In-Network Providers**: Engaging services from in-network providers ensures that treatment costs are lower, and coverage terms are optimally met.\\n  \\n- **Leverage Available Tools**: Utilize the cost estimator tool and provider directory offered by the plan. These resources help in planning healthcare visits and services, projecting costs, and ensuring provider compatibility.\\n\\n- **Stay Informed About Coverage**: Keeping abreast with the policy details and updates ensures that one is aware of the coverage limitations and conditions, preventing unexpected expenses.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nThe Northwind Standard plan offers robust healthcare coverage for essential medical, vision, and dental needs, positioning itself as an attractive option for those prioritizing preventive care and prescription management. However, its exclusion of emergency, mental health services, and out-of-network care necessitates careful planning and consideration, especially for individuals with specific healthcare needs beyond basic preventive and standard care. Subscribers must engage with in-network providers and use provided plan resources to maximize benefits effectively.\"\n",
