    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll use the Azure AI Agent Service to create an agent that is able to retrieve information from documents stored in Azure AI Search, a vector database. This pattern is known as retrieval augmented generation or RAG. The documents that we'll be searching are finance data."

    "### Part 1: Create the Azure AI Search Index\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start the lab by creating an Azure AI Search index, which will contain vectorized representations of our finance documents. The steps shown below to create the AI Search index are from the official Microsoft [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-get-started-portal-import-vectors?tabs=sample-data-storage%2Cmodel-aoai%2Cconnect-data-storage)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1\n",
    "To begin, download the [documents](https://github.com/jakeatmsft/fsi-azure-ai-agents-lab/tree/main/labs/data) that we'll store in the Azure AI Search index.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2\n",
    "Next, we'll upload the data documents to Azure Blob Storage, which Azure AI search connects to.\n",
    "1. Navigate to your Storage Account (the one that was created automaticall during your AI Foundry project setup). \n",
    "2. Expand \"Data Storage\" in the side menu and click on \"Containers\". \n",
    "3. Create a new container named \"financedata\"\n",
    "4. Click into the new container and upload the documents you downloaded.\n",
    "5. If you are not able to access blob storage to upload documents the enable public access with your ip to upload documents\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3\n",
    "We need an embedding model in order to convert our documents into vectors that will be stored in Azure AI Search...Deploy `text-embedding-3-large` model in AOAI service (It has to be differrent AOAI service than the AI foundry project)! DO not use AI foundry project as it only support cohere and facbook embeddings models with AI search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4\n",
    "Now we're ready to vectorize our documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to your AOAI Service (It has to be differrent AOAI service than the AI foundry project) where your  `text-embedding-3-large` model is deployed and grant Cognitive Services OpenAI User role to AI search which is connected to your AI foundry project. If you want to use different AI search than make its connection is defined in AI foundry under connections.\n",
    "1. DO not use AI foundry project as it only support cohere and facbook embeddings models with AI search.\n",
    "1. On the **Overview page**, select **Import and vectorize data**.\n",
    "1. On **Set up your data connection**, select **Azure Blob Storage**.\n",
    "1. Specify your subscription, storage account, and the container that contains your finance data. \n",
    "1. Make sure **Authenticate using managed idenity is checked** and the **Managed identity type** is set to **System-assigned**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. On the **Vectorize your text** page, select **Azure OpenAI** for **Kind**, select your subscription, and select the name of your Azure OpenAI Service.\n",
    "6. For the **Model deployment** select `text-embedding-3-large`. \n",
    "7. The **Authentication type** should be set to **System-assigned identity**. \n",
    "8. Select the box next to the acknowledgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. You can hit **Next** for the next two pages. When you get to the **Review and create** page, set **Objects name prefix** to **financedata-index**. \n",
    "10. Click **Create**. This will start the document indexing process which will vectorize your documents and create an index.\n",
