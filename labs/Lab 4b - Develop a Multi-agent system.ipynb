    "\n",
    "In this lab, we’ll build a multi-agent system where a team of agents works together to generate detailed analyst reports about corporate finance data. The system consists of three task agents plus an orchestrator:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FinanceDataAgent – This agent searches an Azure AI Search index to retrieve recent financial information and performance data for your company.\n",
    "2. AnalystReportAgent – This agent writes a detailed analyst report synthesizing the retrieved data, including insights on financial performance, Finance trends, and risk analysis.\n",
    "3. ValidationAgent – This agent validates that the final report includes a detailed risk assessment.\n",
    "4. FinanceOrchestratorAgent – The orchestrator that communicates with the above agents to create the final analyst report.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Azure AI Agent Service for the individual task agents and Semantic Kernel to build the orchestrator.\n",

Leveraging financial data on gross sales, unit sales, discounts, and profitability, this report identifies areas of strength, underperformance, and growth potential. Key insights are coupled with strategic recommendations to fine-tune discounting policies and bolster market presence.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Key Performance Insights:\\n\\n#### 1. **Government Segment:**\\n   - **Performance Highlights:**\\n     - **Gross Sales and Units Sold:** By far, the Government segment leads Velo’s discount sales performance in Europe, reporting the highest volume of gross sales and units sold. This is driven by high demand in government contracts, supported by substantial discounts.\\n     - **Profitability:** Despite strong sales figures, profitability in this segment is modest. The aggressive discounting applied has eroded margins, suggesting that sales growth is being achieved at the expense of profits.\\n\\n   - **Strategic Implications:**\\n     - While high volumes of sales make the Government segment a critical revenue driver, the weak profitability warrants concern. Discounts remain a double-edged sword: they stimulate demand but do so by potentially undermining long-term financial sustainability.\\n\\n   - **Recommendation:** Optimize discounting policies in this segment to improve profitability without significantly reducing sales volume. A nuanced approach such as a tiered discounting model or a tighter focus on high-margin products could help balance revenue growth and profitability.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 2. **Small Business Segment:**\\n   - **Performance Highlights:**\\n     - **Gross Sales and Profitability:** The Small Business segment reports strong gross sales and a healthy balance between volume and profitability. Unlike the Government segment, discounts in this category are moderate, yet they are effective at driving demand.\\n     - **Growth Dynamics:** The financial data suggests that this segment has strong growth potential, underpinned by the ability to maintain acceptable profit margins even with continued discounting strategies.\\n\\n   - **Strategic Implications:** \\n     - The Small Business segment demonstrates a model of sustainable profitability, where moderate discounts foster both unit sales and margins. This segment represents a promising expansion opportunity for Velo's discount strategy, particularly as small businesses tend to be more agile in responding to promotional offers.\\n\\n   - **Recommendation:** Continue to leverage the Small Business segment through targeted marketing campaigns and tailored discount offers. Investing further in understanding the needs of this segment—such as bundling or product customization strategies—could unlock additional growth potential.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 3. **Channel Partners, Enterprise, and Midmarket Segments:**\\n   - **Performance Highlights:**\\n     - **Minimal Engagement:** These three segments collectively show poor performance across all key metrics, including gross sales, units sold, and profits.\\n     - **Low Discounts:** The primary reason for limited demand appears to be the relatively low level of discounts offered in these segments, which fails to attract sufficient customer interest or stimulate high transaction volumes.\\n\\n   - **Strategic Implications:**\\n     - A lack of engagement in these segments weakens Velo’s market diversity and may pose risks in terms of long-term sustainability. In particular, Channel Partners and Enterprise segments are traditionally premium markets that can provide high margins but require customized engagement strategies to drive demand. Meanwhile, Midmarket represents a middle ground that could generate meaningful revenue with the right value offerings.\\n\\n   - **Recommendations:**\\n     - **Channel Partners:** Strengthen partnerships through targeted incentives, such as volume-based discounts, loyalty programs, or co-marketing opportunities.\\n     - **Enterprise:** Develop tailored solutions that align with the strategic needs of large businesses. Consider introducing high-value bundles or service packages alongside moderate discounts to attract enterprise clients.\\n     - **Midmarket:** Address the midmarket segment with strategic promotions that highlight value over cost. For example, offering periodic moderate discounts, or bundling discounts with after-sales services, could help improve traction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Comparative Analysis:\\n\\n| **Segment**       | **Gross Sales** | **Units Sold** | **Discount Levels** | **Profitability** | **Performance**       |\\n|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|\\n| Government         | Highest         | Highest        | Substantial          | Modest            | Strong in volume, weak in profits  |\\n| Small Business     | Notable         | Notable        | Moderate             | Balanced          | Strong and sustainable |\\n| Channel Partners   | Minimal         | Minimal        | Low                  | Minimal           | Underperforming       |\\n| Enterprise         | Minimal         | Minimal        | Low                  | Minimal           | Underperforming       |\\n| Midmarket          | Minimal         | Minimal        | Low                  | Minimal           | Underperforming       |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Recommendations:\\n\\n#### 1. **Optimize Government Segment Profit Margins:**\\n   - Introduce more precise discounting strategies, such as tiered pricing based on purchase volume or focusing on high-margin products. Evaluate the performance of key clients to determine who delivers the best ROI and allocate discounts accordingly.\\n\\n#### 2. **Expand Growth in the Small Business Segment:**\\n   - Double down on marketing and outreach efforts targeting small businesses. Develop flexible discount strategies that include seasonal promotions or customized business offers. Invest in R&D to create small-business-specific product bundles or services to deepen engagement.\\n\\n#### 3. **Revive Channel Partners, Enterprise, and Midmarket Segments:**\\n   - **Channel Partners:** Establish joint marketing campaigns and restructure incentive schemes. Build long-term relationships by positioning discounts as part of a loyalty program.\\n   - **Enterprise:** Focus on deeper engagement through customization. Introduce services or support bundles in addition to product discounts to make Velo more appealing to large businesses.\\n   - **Midmarket:** Develop promotional campaigns to target midmarket's price sensitivity while emphasizing added value. Consider bundling products at discounted prices to create volume-scale efficiency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\n\\nVelo's discount sales strategy in Europe demonstrates a clear dichotomy between segments. While the Government and Small Business tiers dominate in terms of performance, profitability remains a concern for the former, and optimizing engagement in the latter could unlock further growth potential. Conversely, minimal sales and profits in the Channel Partners, Enterprise, and Midmarket segments highlight untapped opportunities that require strategic adjustments in discounting and marketing efforts.\\n\\nBy recalibrating discount strategies and strengthening segment-specific engagement, Velo can achieve not only balanced growth across all segments but also a more sustainable financial trajectory.\"}\n",
